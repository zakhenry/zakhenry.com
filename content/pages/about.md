I'm Zak Henry, a chief engineer at [CloudNC](https://cloudnc.com), working fully remote in Wānaka New Zealand since 2021.

Prior to moving back home I did a five-year stint in London, UK and three years in Sydney, Australia before that.

My software engineering career has ranged from full stack web, to pure frontend and back to full stack including desktop.

I'm passionate about developer experience, and building a robust software practice that enables developers to focus on 
the fun part - building new things with confidence.
